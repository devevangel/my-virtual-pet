# Robot Dojo

This is my implementation of the virtual pet course work. In my project I went with the idea of having a robot as virtual pet, as I believe that machines have become part of our everyday life to help improve overall well being and standard of living of it's users. Therefore having a robot as a virtual pet to improve your productivity and well being is very much necessary. Below are the features of the virtual pet.
