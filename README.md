# Robot Dojo

Welcome to Robo Dojo Inc.! a web application that provides you with the ability to create, own, and interact with a virtual pet robot. I opted to create a robot as a virtual pet for my coursework as I wanted to do something different from my classmates and the fact that I found the concept of a robot as a virtual pet to be very cool.

## About The Project

This section provides an overview of the various components and files that comprise the robot app, as well as their respective functions. Its objective is to provide a high-level understanding of the entire application and how all the pieces fit together.

The project is divided into two main parts, which are:

### [Server Side](https://github.com/devevangel/my-virtual-pet/blob/main/server.js)

This refers to the part of the application that handles all network requests made from the client side and sends a response accordingly. It houses the database, a universal storage location for the entire app, the Database Management Systems (DBMS), which provides an efficient way of communicating with the database and the client side through the use of queries sent from the client side. Finally, the controllers these are functions that are called when certain conditions are met. They communicate with the DBMS and the client side. Here are the components/files that make up the server side:

#### [Robot Database](https://github.com/devevangel/my-virtual-pet/blob/main/database/robots-database.json)

This is a lightweight JSON global storage location for the entire application. It houses data about every user currently signed up on the application and their respective robot pets in a key-value pair format. The database provides every user with the ability to access their pet from any machine or mobile device. Here is a sample of the database structure:

```json
{
        "232543224532": {
        "id": "R7fUN",
        "name": "Javis",
        "owner": "232543224532",
        "timeLived": "2023-04-21T04:50:33.076Z",
        "skinclass": "robo-orange",
        "version": 6,
        "chargePercent": 90,
        "cachePercent": 100,
        "cacheList": []
    }
}

```

#### [Robot Database Manager](https://github.com/devevangel/my-virtual-pet/blob/main/database/database-manager.js)

This is a simple custom-built JavaScript class that handles direct communication with the robot JSON database. It exposes top-level functions that provide the ability to add new object data to the database, update existing object data, retrieve object data, and delete object data. I decided to implement this feature because during the development period of this project, I was learning about Database Management Systems (DBMS), specifically PostgresSQL. A DBMS is a software tool that provides an efficient way to communicate between a database and a user-facing application. It prevents direct user communication with the database, which could lead to data corruption or ultimately data loss.

#### [Robot Controller](https://github.com/devevangel/my-virtual-pet/blob/main/controllers/robot.js)

These are a set of functions that carry out specific tasks when called. Each function takes a request and response parameter that enables them to accept requests from the client side and send a response. The functions are mounted on routes, and whenever a route is hit from the client side, the respective function is called, and a response is sent accordingly. These functions make use of the top-level functions exposed by the robot DBMS to perform certain tasks in the robot database and provide a suitable response to the client side. The robot controller contains functions that handle signing up and creating a new pet, getting an existing robot pet, updating a robot pet, as well as deleting a robot pet from the robot database.

### [Client Side](https://github.com/devevangel/my-virtual-pet/tree/main/client)

this refers to the part of the application that is closer to the user. It contains all the code responsible for handling the main logic of the application that the user sees and interacts with. The front-end is responsible for showing the user interface and providing output to user interactions also it is respo Components/files that make up the client side:

#### [Global Storage](https://github.com/devevangel/my-virtual-pet/blob/main/client/scripts/robot-global-store.mjs)

This consist of the Robo Dojo main database located on the server, the robot in app JSON storage unit which makes use of the browser localstorage, the main robot cache memory that stores user command history built on top of the JSON localstorage unit and the robot RAM which is a volatile in runtime storage unit.

- Custom built JSON database and Database Management System [DBMS](https://github.com/devevangel/my-virtual-pet/blob/main/database/database-manager.js) (server).
- In app JSON based quick read/write storage unit (localstorage - client).
- Robot main cache memory (an implementation of the in app JSON localstorage unit - client).
- Runtime storage unit (RAM - client)

#### [Text Processor](https://github.com/devevangel/my-virtual-pet/blob/main/client/scripts/robot-text-processor.mjs)

This is the component of the robot responsible for processing user text input to enable the robot provide useful responses or output. 80% of the robots funtionality can be accessed via the text processor. The text processor makes use of a very simple text processing system which has the potential to be developed into a more complex system to better handle user input as well improve robot responses. This processor also helps in determining the current mood of the robot which includes: Very Happy, Happy, Sad, Angry, Sleep and Dead. 

#### [Game Processor](https://github.com/devevangel/my-virtual-pet/blob/main/client/scripts/robot-game-processor.mjs)

This is an extenstion of the text processor. The game processor component of the robot handles the gamplay process within the app. It provides the abliltiy to play a guess the number game where the robot generates a random number between a given min and max value and the user tries to guess the number right. This processor helps in updating the robot game mode.

#### [Operating System](https://github.com/devevangel/my-virtual-pet/blob/main/client/scripts/robot-operating-system.mjs)

This is the major component of the entire robot as it controls all other aspects of the robots. It's functions include:
- Memory managemnt and usage
- Display of the various robot stats
- Calculations of variaous values
- Handles game play initialization
- Powering on and loading stored data
- Handles version updates
- Error handling and display
- Making network requests

## What I Learnt

## About My Course Work

I opted to create a robot as a virtual pet for my coursework as I wanted to do something different from my classmates and the fact that I found the concept of a robot as a virtual pet to be very cool.

In order to enhance the interaction of my virtual pet, I integrated a user text response feature inspired by ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT is based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, and has the ability to generate text that resembles human language in response to user prompts. To implement this feature, I created my own simple text processor engine which can process user input and generate friendly, human-like responses.

From my Database Management Systems (DBMS) classes, I learned about the benefits of using DBMS, which are software tools designed to facilitate efficient communication between a database and a user's application. Using this knowledge, I developed my own custom DBMS to manage my entire robot database.

To modularize my project, I attempted to display the different parts (files) that constitute the entire robot and its capabilities. To accomplish this, I drew inspiration from my core first-year courses: Database Management Systems (DBMS), Networks, Architecture and Operating Systems, and Application Programming. That is why I named my JavaScript files as so:

- "robot-game-processor.mjs": contains all the functions that manage the complete game process of the robot, including starting the game, running the main game logic, and ending the game.

- In "robot-network-drivers.mjs": you can find all the functions that utilize the browser's fetch API. This API enables web applications to send network requests to servers and receive responses from them. The file includes functions that make network requests to update, get, create, and delete robot data, and their respective server responses sent to different parts of the robot application for use.

- "robot-operating-system.mjs": contains the core functions of the robot as the name suggests. The file includes functions that assist the robot in processing various user inputs, handle quick read/write actions to the robot's storage unit, allow the robot to calculate and display its various values and mood, and more.

- "robot-global-store.mjs": includes variables that are accessed in multiple files within the robot's file structure. To implement this, I drew inspiration from the Redux store concept, which is a global statement management system designed to simplify accessing and mutating data across an application. Since it was becoming cumbersome to manage data that frequently changed within a single file where it's used the most, I created the "robot-global-store" file to provide easy read and write access to variables that are accessed in multiple places within the application.

- "robot-text-processor.mjs" includes the function that takes parsed user input, runs it through a simple text processor, and responds with a user-friendly output message. To implement this feature, I drew ideas from the ChatGPT user text reponse funtionality.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, working on this coursework project provided me with valuable lessons. I gained a deeper understanding of why certain software tools were created and the challenges they aim to solve, such as Redux and Database Management Systems. This helped me appreciate their usefulness better. I also learned how to use tools like ChatGPT to help me write good code documentation and comments, which is important for creating maintainable and understandable code.

For my final remarks, I would like to say that there is always room for improvement within the codebase. Functions can be written better, and files and folders could be structured in a more efficient way. However, one of the major reasons I chose the current structure of my codebase was to avoid issues of plagiarism. Many students asked me to explain the reasoning behind my coding patterns and ideas, and I often had to teach and provide practical help to them. Occasionally, some of them took a sneak peek at my codebase to borrow a few ideas, which was why I had to be cautious. Nonetheless, I am proud of what I have accomplished so far and look forward to improving my coding skills in the future.
